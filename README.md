# AI-and-Applied-ML-Coursework

This is a repo containing my submitted coursework for the module AI and Applied ML, on my Data Science MSc.

The brief contains the information I was given about the task and the marking criteria.

The data used was a csv file given called BankChurners. It contains data from the customers of a credit card company and whether they churn or not.
